Summary Insights:

       I) High abandonment at both the cart (90.28%) and checkout (85.31%) stages points to potential 
       friction in the purchase journey. Addressing issues like user experience, ease of 
       checkout, or offering incentives could reduce abandonment rates and improve conversions.

      II) Conversion rate (2.11%) is low, which might be expected given the high abandonment rates, 
      but it presents a clear opportunity for optimization in the conversion process
      (e.g.,  ptimizing for mobile users, improving site speed, or offering incentives for completing purchases).

      III) The Average Order Value of $63.63 suggests that, while revenue is being generated,
      higher AOV could be achievable through strategies like cross-selling, up-selling, or 
       introducing higher-value products.


##### ✅ Device Category Performance: Identify Conversion Rate Differences by Device:

This query provides insights into how users are converting across different devices and
platforms (desktop, mobile, tablet), helping you determine if certain devices are underperforming.
```sql
SELECT  
    device.category AS device_category,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_pseudo_id) AS total_users,
    COUNTIF(event_name = 'purchase') AS total_purchase,
    SUM(CAST(ecommerce.total_item_quantity AS INT64)) AS total_sold, 
    SUM(CAST(ecommerce.purchase_revenue AS FLOAT64)) AS total_revenue, 
    ROUND(SAFE_DIVIDE(COUNT(DISTINCT IF(event_name = 'purchase', user_pseudo_id, NULL)), COUNT(DISTINCT IF(event_name = 'page_view', user_pseudo_id, NULL)))*100,2) AS conversion_rate  -- Correct conversion rate calculation
FROM `bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce.events_*`
WHERE event_name IN ('purchase', 'page_view')  -- Consider both purchase and page view events
GROUP BY device_category
ORDER BY conversion_rate DESC;
